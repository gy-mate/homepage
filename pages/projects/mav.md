In 2018, ...

Because V43 locomotives are unreliable and have only 2200 kW of traction power, 
instead of increasing the number of carriages from 
[~6](https://www.vagonweb.cz/razeni/vlak.php?rok=2018&id=22385) to 12, MÁV 
[ran an extra train](https://web.archive.org/web/20220119020612/https://www.mavcsoport.hu/sites/default/files/upload/page/100_sz._vonal_mentesito_vonatok_2018.12.21_v1214.pdf#page=2)
(S 16290) on 21 December just 5 minutes after IC 606. 
The operating time of the InterCity service was also extended until 20:23 with the new IC 628.

IC 628 was kept in the timetable permanently for Fridays and Sundays and 
[runs ever since](https://web.archive.org/web/20251220232135/https://www.mavcsoport.hu/sites/default/files/upload/page/100_v0905.pdf#page=15).
